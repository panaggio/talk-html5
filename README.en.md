# Document Freedom Day 2011 / Unicamp - HTML 5 Talk

This is the source code of the slides I used for my HTML 5 talk at Unicamp's
Document Freedom Day 2011.

## Usage #

If you want to run this presentation, you should first get it from Github
and then run the ShowOff server:

    $ git clone git://github.com/panaggio/talk:html5.git
    $ cd talk:html5
    $ showoff serve

Then you should be able to go to
[http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) to view the presentation.

Enjoy! :)

This presentation is meant to be run using ShowOff, as said before. See the
next section for more info on how to get it.

## Requirements

If you want to see these slides from source, you should install ShowOff first:

    $ gem install showoff

## ShowOff

[Scott Chacon](https://github.com/schacon/) is an awesome guy and created
ShowOff, an awesome presentation web app.

These slide were made for my talk on Document Freedom Day 2011 / Unicamp. But
you can use it for your own study, or for a talk of yours if you want. You
